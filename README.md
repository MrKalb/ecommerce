To Configure the DB 

(You can change the password in persistence.xml) 

User = postgres
password = admin 

(I will post the DLL files soon) 

Or you can just change the persistence.xml, adding this line 


# Remember to first create the DB, just to avoid some error. 

<property name="hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto" value="update" /> <!-- create / create-drop / update -->
